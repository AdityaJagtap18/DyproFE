        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>

            This study is motivated by the lack of research on predicting class attendance in the field of pedagogy.
            Frequently,<br>
            previous research conducted in the field of pedagogy concerned predicting students’ performance using class
            attendance<br>
            as predictor, where little research focused on predicting class attendance. The aims to investigate the
            probability of<br>
            predicting class attendance for students’ personal development, for professors’ preparation and
            intervention, and to<br>
            optimize universities’ educational program are explained. The dataset obtained by the Student life study is
            used to<br>
            conduct four experiments for predicting class attendance. The problem statement addressed in this thesis
            reads as<br>
            follows: The techniques considered are Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes. The main findings
            are that<br>
            class attendance can be predicted based on python programming and can be display on web application.<br>

        <h1>About ML</h1>
        <p>
            • Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to
            become more
            accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so.<br>
            • Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.<br>
            • Classical machine learning is often categorized by how an algorithm learns to become more accurate in its
            predictions.<br>
            • There are four basic approaches supervised learning , unsupervised learning , semi-supervised learning and
            reinforcement learning<br>
            • The type of algorithm data scientists choose to use depends on what type of data they want to predict.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            • Supervised learning: In this type of machine learning, data scientists supply algorithms with labeled
            training data<br>
            and define the variables they want the algorithm to assess for correlations. Both the input and the output
            of the
            algorithm is specified.<br>
            • Unsupervised learning: This type of machine learning involves algorithms that train on unlabeled data. The
            algorithm
            scans through data sets looking for any meaningful connection. The data that algorithms train on as well as
            the
            predictions or recommendations they output are predetermined.<br>
            • Semi-supervised learning: This approach to machine learning involves a mix of the two preceding types.
            Data scientists
            may feed an algorithm mostly labeled training data, but the model is free to explore the data on its own and
            develop its
            own understanding of the data set.<br>
            • Reinforcement learning: Data scientists typically use reinforcement learning to teach a machine to
            complete a
            multi-step process for which there are clearly defined rules. Data scientists program an algorithm to
            complete a task
            and give it positive or negative cues as it works out how to complete a task. But for the most part, the
            algorithm
            decides on its own what steps to take along the way.<br>

        <h1>Data Preparation</h1>
        <p>
            • The mock dataset contains ____ data for ____ different students and __ attributes spanning both their
            personal and
            student life .<br>
            • The data has been cleaned using standard method that check for data consistency and however it is not
            based on real
            survey responses.<br>
            • In order to have a specific model some of these attributes have been neglected and finally 14 out of these
            above
            parameters were taken into consideration based on their relevance to our research.<br>
            • All the textual responses were given numerical weights according to their significance. 'Yes' is taken to
            be 1, 'no'
            to be 0 and a 'maybe' to be 0.5.<br>
            • All 'NaN' (not a number) cells were replaced with 0. 80 percent of the responses were used for training
            the model
            while the remaining 20 percent was utilized for testing.<br>
            • The dataset contains features which reflect human behaviors ; such behaviors may correlate differently in
            other
            geographic locations , Institutes , Professional Courses .<br>

        <br>
        <h2>Decision Tree</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            A decision tree can be used to model multiple choices or if-else statements/decisions in a tree-like
            fashion.
            Here, decision trees are used to find the most contributing factors among the 6 features that are used.
            This is highly helpful, as now more attention can be given to these areas and necessary steps are taken on
            those lines.

        <h2>Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier</h2>
        <p>A Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier is a probabilistic Machine learning model that is used for classification
            task . The
            crux of
            the classifier is based on the Bayes theorem.

            Naïve Bayes is also used to discriminate different objects based on certain features.

            Naïve Bayes is Probabilistic in nature.

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>

            • Education institutes are very concerned about the behavior of students towards punctuality at class.<br>
            • However those Students who are habitually late and looking for excuses to bunk/miss the lecture can be a
            real
            candidate for poor performance or dropouts.<br>
            • In order to avoid the critical issue of absenteeism this project work with the help of structured
            methodology using
            machine learning and different models have been presented which can determine the behavior of such students
            towards
            punctuality at class at the very early stage of their semester.<br>
            • The results obtained have demonstrated lower accuracy by the proposed model due to mock data however can
            show a great
            potential to be scaled by using a big dataset for real-world problems.<br>
            • The most important contribution of the paper is to analyze the parameters used for student analysis and
            devise a deep
            learning-based model to make prediction of absenteeism behavior in student.<br>
            • It also highlights the contributions of different factors that can possibly result in absenteeism of
            student and is a
            good source for institute to further look into those areas.<br>
